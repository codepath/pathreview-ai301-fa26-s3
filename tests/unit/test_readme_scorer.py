        # Project Name
        A comprehensive project description.

        Project Name is a small web service that collects reading notes from
        several sources, groups them by book and topic, and lets you search
        them from one place. It started as a weekend tool for a study group
        and grew into something the whole group uses every week. The goal is
        to keep the setup simple enough that a new contributor can run it on
        a laptop in a few minutes, while still being solid enough to deploy
        for a small team.

        The service exposes a JSON API and a minimal web page. Notes are
        stored in PostgreSQL, and full-text search uses the database's
        built-in text search, so there is no separate search server to run.

        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip install package
        ```

        You need Python 3.9 or newer and a running PostgreSQL server. Create
        a virtual environment first so the dependencies stay separate from
        your system packages. After installing, copy the example settings
        file to a new file named settings.toml and fill in your database
        address, user name, and password. Then run the migration command
        once to create the tables. If the migration fails, check that the
        database user is allowed to create tables in the target database.

        ## Usage
        ```python
        import package
        package.run()
        ```

        Calling run starts the web server on port 8000 by default. Open the
        home page in a browser to add a note, or send a POST request to the
        notes endpoint with a title, a body, and an optional list of tags.
        Each note gets an identifier that you can use to read, update, or
        delete it later. The search endpoint takes a query string and
        returns matching notes ordered by how well they match, with the
        newest notes first when two results score the same.

        You can also import notes in bulk from a CSV file with one note per
        row. The importer skips rows that are missing a title and prints a
        short report at the end that lists how many rows were added, skipped,
        or rejected, so you can fix the file and run it again.

        ![Build Status](https://example.com/badge.svg)
        ![Coverage](https://example.com/coverage.svg)

        ## Live Demo
        [Try it here](https://demo.example.com)

        The public instance resets every night, so feel free to add test
        notes there. Please do not store anything private on it.

        ## Configuration
        All settings live in settings.toml. The most important ones are the
        database address, the port the server listens on, and the page size
        used by the search endpoint. Every setting can also be overridden
        with an environment variable of the same name in capital letters,
        which is the easiest way to configure the service in a container.

        ## Running the Tests
        The test suite uses pytest. Unit tests run without a database and
        finish in a few seconds. Integration tests need a throwaway
        PostgreSQL database; point the test settings at it before running
        them, because the tests drop and recreate every table they use.

        ## Contributing
        Contributions are welcome. Open an issue first to describe the bug
        or idea, so we can agree on the approach before you write code. Keep
        each pull request focused on one change, add or update tests for the
        behavior you touch, and run the linter and the full test suite
        locally before asking for a review. Be kind in reviews and
        discussions; everyone here is learning.
